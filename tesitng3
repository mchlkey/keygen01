    <h1>Meet Your New Boss - <a href="https://www.claudineko.com/storiesamericanapparel.html">Article<a/> by Claudine Ko</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He says I seduced him when I told him I liked dirty stories. We were standing on a corner in New York's Lower East Side after a long day of trudging from one of his retail stores to another. At first, between incessant interruptions from his cell phone, he talked manically about progressive labor issues, manifest destiny, sexism, feminism; the mercantile lives of his grandparents and selling home-bottled "spring" water in Hellmann's jars as a child in Montreal. Then he told me a story about humping a model from the nudie mag Perfect 10. And that is how I ended up in a 10th-floor suite of the trendy Maritime Hotel around 11 p.m. with Dov Charney, the 35-year-old senior partner and founder of American Apparel, and one of his female employees. I asked him how he relaxed.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Explaining exactly how the rest of the night unraveled is somewhat difficult. Let's just say, the female employee helped him "put on a show" for me. I watched, trying to be objective, detached -- sorta like a...war reporter?</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If you aren't familiar with American Apparel and Dov's mutton chopped, handlebar-mustached face, you will be soon enough. With a new push from wholesale-only to retail, Dov wants his $150 million clothing company to become the Starbucks of T-shirts. In fact, go into your closet and check your labels. Chances are you own at least a couple of their logo-free, formfitting Classic Girl tees, customized by your favorite brand or indie designer. Or maybe you've noticed their provocative, kiddie-porn-like ads in Vice and other alternative rags. A typical ad shows a girl wearing #8315 red boy briefs, photographed from her upper thighs to her bare midriff, sitting back on a laundry machine, and reads in big block letters: SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WASHING MACHINE. CALIFORNIA. Down a bit, in smaller print, is the trademark SWEATSHOP FREE T-SHIRTS, MADE IN LA.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Originally, I'd wanted to write about the lives of garment workers. Then I saw one of the American Apparel ads beckoning, "Come see what we're doing." So I thought I'd drop by their factory and find out whether a clothing manufacturer really could be profitable without the standard appalling employment abuses. What I discovered was not only a company trying to fix the system, but what Dov calls an "industrial revolution."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"I think sex motivates everything," he says, peering at me from behind his boxy '70s frames. In fact, he essentially invented girly-cut printable tees after an Argentinean ex-girlfriend told him she couldn't stand wearing those big, American Hard Rock ones popularized in the '80s. "It motivates my work, too. You don't want something that's sexually driven, like panties, but then have them made in a horrible sweatshop. Like, I know my workers have a good time. They drink beer, they have relationships, they have girlfriends." Plus, he adds, "It's fun to make money and pay people well."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Posted on flyers and his Web site -- and screening on TV monitors in his vivid, meticulously designed retail stores -- is a barrage of propagandistic words promoting the company and Dov's new way of doing business. With his own face prominently featured, the air of idolatry is heavy.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"I don't believe in God. I'm a pure Jewish hustler," the Choate grad and Tufts University dropout says, pacing the office of one of his Manhattan stores. "To me, there's no other way but to be a capitalist. I don't like the phrase"sweetshop-free" anymore because it's crybaby; it's 'Buy from us because we're trying harder to treat the people better.' What it is to me is another level of efficiency...make sure you pay wages that are internationally acceptable and that your business model doesn't rely upon these cute labor inequalities that are really vestiges of the past."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When I check out the headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, the environment really does seem pleasant. The giant production floors in the seven-story industrial warehouse are sunlight-filled spaces with clean stacks of brightly colored tees, massage therapists to assuage employees' muscle pains and pods of intent garment makers who have optional health-care packages, subsidized transportation and free English-as-a second-language classes. During breaks, workers socialize and laugh--I spy a couple snuggling in a stairwell. And on Fridays, they pile into a sample sale to buy their own goods at $1 to $2 apiece, which is less than the $3 manufacturing cost of their basic shirt--not to mention the $16 retail.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"It's very different here," says Yesenia Sandoval, 22, a seamstress. She came from Mexico five years ago, worked at another factory, then got a job here last fall. "This company is much better than the other one. I was receiving minimum wage [$6.75 per hour]. Here we earn $12 to $15. I don't think any company is going to be better than this."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The more women I talk to, the more I wonder if they've all been seduced by Dov's odd charisma. "There's no tribe," Dov insists. "It's a misconception to say it's a cult. It's about being free. It's about telling the boss, 'F--k you.'"</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Merrily Lupo, a designer, has worked with him for over five years and says it's more like a family business with 1,500 employees. "You can ask him to borrow money and he'll usually do it," she says. "If American Apparel is a cult, then democracy is a cult. It's a project. It's just an art project."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite a lingering cold, Dov invites me to hang out again a week after our first meeting. He and Iris Alonzo, his five-foot-eleven, Maggie Gyllenhaal-esque assistant and content advisor ("I'm kind of his bitch," she explains), are in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, checking out more retail space. He says his ultimate market can be found in hip neighborhoods like this one, the Lower East Side and Echo Park in L. A. "It's great to be near a bookstore -- near intelligence," says Dov, the son of an architect dad and artist mom. "It gives it a noninstitutional, community feel." Throughout the evening, he lathers us with lecture upon lecture about a burgeoning international youth culture, questioning authority, and Camille Paglia. At dinner, Dov jokes in a childish tone, which he often uses, that I'm his "date." When the watiress comes, I find myself automatically ordering for both of us, like I'm his mom or something. At midnight, when Iris leaves to hang out with a friend, Dov gets distinctly quiet. "Keep me in your pocket. Call me if you need anything," she says, giving him back his cell phone. So Dov and I take a car back to the modest two-bedroom apartment he rented to avoid being stuck in the hotel for the rest of his time here on business. Out on the sidewalk, he fiddles with the keys before realizing we're at the wrong door, explaining that this is the first time he's actually opened it. Iris usually does it for him.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Are you going to do it again?" I ask.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And thus begins another compulsive episode of what Dov likes to call self pleasure, during which we casually carry on our interview, discussing things like business models, hiring practices and the stupidity of focus groups.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Masturbation in front of women is underrated," Dov explains to me later over the phone. "It's much easier on the woman. She gets to watch, it's a sensual experience that doesn't involve a man violating a woman, yet once the man has his release, it's over and you can talk to the guy." And, Iris adds on another day, "I think it's really healthy to have an orgasm four times a day. It's got to be great for business." In his apartment that night, when he finishes, he promptly turns back to reading the rest of his e-mail. His in-box holds 21,547 messages. He clicks on one that displays a photo of a twentysomething Asian girl wearing tight jeans, lying in bed. Her message reads, "I'm 5'4", 106 pounds, bust size 32B-C. Plus, I'm professional, artistic..." Dov says he gets an email like this every 48 hours from women wanting to work for him.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Overall, his company is almost fifty-fifty gender-wise and women fill a lot of the higher positions. Of course, he also has tons of attractive, diverse models -- many of whom are girls he's recruited on the street. "[Some] might say that this girl with the big tits is the right girl, but if I took a picture of you right now? You're it, you're the Classic Girl. You look beautiful. You're relaxed, you're confident; your hair looks great, you're taking notes. Your [butt] looks good."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We come across photos of Spring Hernandez, whom he met at a hotel rooftop party in L.A. a couple of years ago. "After three or so drinks, he asked to take some pictures," Spring, 25, told me during my L.A. trip. "He had a bag of clothes and he's like, ˜I just want to take one picture.'" One turned into who-knows-how many until security finally asked Dov to leave. A couple of days later, Spring was surprised to find that the photos were already on his Web site. "I was mad -- we'd just had this great conversation about ethics and there was my picture," she said. "He didn't tell me. I called him and he made everything okay after half-an-hour of kissing my butt." She now runs his Echo Park store and is featured in a #4310 white/pink baby rib bikini bra sensually pulling at her long, dark hair on a giant billboard over Sunset Boulevard. The picture is from that day they first met.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dov scrolls through more shots of random women, models and employees. "Look at this cute girl," he says of one who works in the Montreal office. "I wanted her so bad."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"It never causes drama?" I ask.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Damn right it does. You gotta be very carefu -- certain girls can handle it, certain can't." He clicks on a different folder. "Here's a picture of my grandmother's place. Look how cool her furniture is. She's right on point."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"She as horny as you are?"</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"No," he says as we both crack up. "Are you?"</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">All in all, Dov has had serious relationships with only three of his employees -- all cute, clean-faced young women. First, there was Nikki Yang, whom he hired way back in 1996, when, he says, "there were no girls," they were operating from South Carolina and "were dying at all times." She is now the custom-order manager and married Marco Victorino from I.T. last March. Then there was Merrily, who he says is the only girl he thought he could marry. After a dramatic, secret long-term affair, she found someone else and broke up with him. He was so devastated, he couldn't come to the office for weeks, and when he finally returned, would openly weep in the hallways. Still, he was adamant about keeping Merrily with the company. "I'm proud that it happens and we're able to deal with it," he says. "I'm not saying I want to screw all the girls at work -- I'm not a f--kin' madman. But if I fall in love at work, it's going to be beautiful and sexual."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And currently, there is Thida Sheldon, who lives in London, where American Apparel is opening a store, along with ones already or about to open in Montreal, L.A, New York, Frankfurt and Berlin. She was taking a break from school when she was asked to model for the company at a clothing trade show. The night they met, he had an assistant invite her to his hotel room. "I thought it was weird," Thida, 22 says in her British accent, "but I love weird. I'm not like other girls. People were like, 'Be careful, he's a walking erection.' I wanted to know what a 'walking erection' is. So I went to his room and he just starts talking about his company, lying on his bed, like an emperor, really at ease." Deja vu.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Eisenhower chic, that's the look I'm going for," Dov says, describing his personal style. Though on some days -- like the morning he invited me to go flea-market shopping and opened his apartment door wearing #1301 pink jersey P.E shorts, a lemon-yellow terry top, flip-flops and a QUEBEC bucket hat -- he looks more like a '70s roller-derby candy girl gone fishin'. A few days later, he's in a pair of beige vintage Levi's Sta-Prest slacks -- strangely, I own the exact same pants -- and the terry shirt again while we cruise the stroller- and nanny-trafficked sidewalks of New York's Upper West Side with a real estate broker. "All these older business people, for the most part, are playing Wizard of Oz," he says. "We don't really know who Bill Gates is; we don't know what turns Bush's crank. Is he into bestiality or what? Because it can't just be the guy's playing to God." We check out the retail spots of a Banana Republic and a Baby Gap before stepping into another clothing store. A line of cardboard boxes sloppily stuffed with sale items greets us near the entrance. "What is this, a closeout garage sale?" Dov says. "A bigger story is why a company like this isn't making it. Not if I [ get] off. Of course I do. What's new?"</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alexandra Spunt, 24, met Dov when she interviewed him for a Canadian paper. At the end, he said, "You sound cool. Maybe we could work together." Within a month, she'd quit her job, moved to L.A. and started working as his assistant even spending a short period platonically living with him while looking for her own place. Alex now helps Dov with advertising content, hiring, photography, you name it. Inside the factory's art department, we look at an ad where there's a series of photos of Thida in a red bikini-and-brief set. In the final shot, she's plucking her bikini line. "It makes it funny," Alex explains. "We get mixed criticism. Women saying they love that we don't use real models. Or 'You're socially conscious, but exploiting women.' I disagree. It's a fine line. Of course, the women are sexualized in the images, but I don't think anything's wrong with that. It's not just about being socially conscious, it's about being a profitable company." In another ad, Thida and an equally nubile girl are lounging on beach chairs, stripped down to #8301 hot shorts and nothing else. The slogan reads: CAREFREE, COMFORTABLE, COTTON. YOU CAN FEEL HOW GOOD IT LOOKS.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"I love that ad because it's my girlfriend," Dov says. "Thida was comfortable with it, and I wanted to make sure it was kosher with a woman I trust." So he consulted one of his art department employees.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"She was like, 'Can I be in it, too?'" Thida says. "We ended up both going naked on the porch in front of everyone. It was fun, man, it was crazy."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When I recount tales about Dov to friends, I often find myself on the defensive. In a time when the FCC and conservative corporate powers are arbitrarily censoring basic civil liberties, Dov's candor is refreshing. And these women who work with him get it. "You can thank me and Iris and Alex," Dov says of his enlightened company vision. "We all have our fuking d--k in it. It's not just one c--k." Ahem.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"We're the kind of girls that would buy from this company: 24- or 25-year-olds who know what's up," Alex says. "That's why he holds onto us the way he does. We're his demographic. Dov's not sexist. He wants nothing to do with PC backlash. He rejects early-90s feminism. Sure, he might come across as offensive, but truthfully, he really respects women who work here. And he would never hurt anybody....He's never [masturbated] in front of me." I'm a bit surprised to hear that Dov has pretty much told everyone outside his mother about beating off for the reporter. Even Thida knows, though she also isn't really bothered by it. "Maybe if he wasn't where he is now, he'd be one of those perverts on the subway," she says. "But this is his empire, and when you're with him, he welcomes you into his life. That's why I let him do these things. And so long as the girls are okay and have fun, it's great. Go for it, man."</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After a month of watching Dov wheel and deal multimillion-dollar real estate, explain the minutiae of two-needle and blind hems, patronize full-service massage parlors before skipping over to an evening of fine kosher dining, and "pleasure" himself eight or so times, I start to wonder when this Twilight Zone marathon is going to be over. We've just left a porn shop near Times Square, where he's planning to open another store, and I'm thinking it's time to go home. I briefly hesitate as he hails a cab heading downtown, knowing the inevitable rituals of his night are still to, uh, come. Then, as I step into the depths of the backseat, I realize I don't want this trip to end just yet.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> The Resurrection of Dov Charney: Life after American Apparel - <a href=https://lamag.com/celebrity/resurrection-dov-charney/>Article<a/> by Sanjiv Bhattacharya</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Dov Charney paces across the bedroom in a bathrobe and sweatpants, flip-flops and socks. “Don’t worry, I know this business!” he says, nearly yelling into his phone. He’s unshaven, and his sandals slap the travertine floor as he walks. “Trust me! I’ve sold $5 billion of apparel!” </h1>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">    <h1>Certainly he’d created a company as notorious as it was successful. American Apparel began by making basics–tees, hoodies, underwear–and expanded to disco pants and high-waisted jeans to become a label with a vaguely vintage feel. But it was attitude that drove sales. An antibrand that stood for youth and authenticity, American Apparel presented a conundrum: On the one hand, it showed that a company could do well by doing good, by manufacturing in L.A. and being labor friendly (fair wages, health benefits); on the other, its sexually provocative ads featuring everyday girls in scenes of crude, lo-fi sexuality appalled feminists the world over. “Now Open” one read next to a model with her legs splayed. The United Kingdom went so far as to ban some of Charney’s ads, but teenagers couldn’t get enough. American Apparel went from 3 stores in 2003 to 280 in 2011.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><h1>At one point Charney’s stock was worth more than $500 million. When he was fired in December 2014, it had dropped to $50 million, and less than a year later it was worthless–the company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. By January 2017, American Apparel’s collapse will be complete: Its new owners, the Canadian clothing company Gildan Activewear, will announce massive layoffs as the downtown L.A. factory teeters on closure.</h1>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney, however, will already be forging a fresh path–a new company, much like the old one. He calls it Los Angeles Apparel, and it starts here with a man in a robe coaxing money from an investor. Like Steve Jobs, his favorite ousted founder, he’s plunging into his phoenix phase.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>And that means spending a lot of time focused on money–raising it, saving it, explaining how he’ll make it. Charney had plowed so much of his wealth into American Apparel–$13 million all told–that there was little left and certainly no parachute, golden or otherwise, to soften the landing. He refinanced his home, an eight-bedroom Silver Lake mansion on Apex Avenue, an ironic address given the circumstances. But he’s also Airbnb-ing a couple of the rooms to help cover the mortgage.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney’s bedroom is his bunker, his war room, his brain. A designer in the corner works on a logo, and T-shirt cutouts lie heaped on the unmade bed, a Magic Wand vibrator among them. Notes and Post-its plaster the wall by Charney’s computer. The mirrors have been scrawled with bullet points and graphs, his former plans to return American Apparel to glory. And everywhere else–on the floor, on the dresser, even in the bathroom sink–there are piles of papers, legal filings, and binders.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“Listen, I know how this works,” he says, glued to the phone. In his pacing he has walked into a narrow closet, where he addresses the back wall. “I’ve done this before, trust me.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>That’s not true, not quite. Charney has recovered from setbacks, but nothing like this. He survived American Apparel’s first bankruptcy, in 1997, the same year the company moved to L.A. from Charleston, and he’s weathered plenty of controversy–for those ads as well as allegations of harassment and lewd behavior, like when he masturbated in front of a female reporter in 2004 (the reporter later wrote that there was no harassment involved). Over these last two years, however, he has not only lost his job but his company and wealth and much more. American Apparel was also his voice, his purpose, and the main source of his friends, lovers, and colleagues.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>As the months pass, he finds some investors, some clients. He hires people to sew, and by this past August, the wheels are turning nicely. Whether at a knitting plant in Vernon or his new factory in South L.A., Charney is a blur–quick on his feet for 48, and loud. He’s a cartoonish figure, with his stubble and large spectacles, tapered sweatpants, plain white tee and sneakers; it’s the same look every day. There’s often an assistant in pursuit, juggling two cell phones and filming him on a selfie stick. Charney yells, he pleads, he bargains. And it never stops. On his drive home he snaps iPhone pictures of old storefronts, a vintage bodega, a mural, for his archive on thatslosangeles.net–all part of the new company’s aesthetic.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>One Saturday afternoon at his house, which he calls a “business campus,” I watch clients and vendors stream to the door–some T-shirt company reps from Illinois, an elastics guy from South L.A. They’re met by Jindo, Charney’s skittish dog, and then any one of his housemates du jour, mostly American Apparel alums who have followed him to the new company. There’s Jan, a soft-spoken production manager from Holland; Houston, a photographer; and four young women–Nicole, Stephanie, Thalia, and Sofia–who, given Charney’s reputation, might be mistaken for a harem. The truth, however, is prosaic: They all say they’re in long-term relationships and here to work.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The Playboy Mansion this is not. Charney doesn’t party; he doesn’t drink or smoke. He watches so little television, he hadn’t heard of House of Cards when I met him. Instead he works up to 100 hours a week and expects much the same of others. At American Apparel he scarcely took a vacation in 20 years. So the personal and professional have always commingled. According to board member Allan Mayer, when he advised the CEO not to date his staff in light of various sexual harassment lawsuits filed against the company, Charney protested: “You’re telling me I can’t have a social life. Because my whole life is this company.” (Charney denies this.)
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>His obsession with work has also led to lawsuits. He’s been accused of yelling and bullying, like when a fired Malibu store manager alleged that Charney called him a homophobic slur and rubbed dirt in his face (the suit was settled). “He’s very intense, very driven, and yeah, maybe not always so empathetic,” says Iris Alonzo, a close friend who spent 11 years at American Apparel, the last 8 as creative director, before starting her own label, Everybody. “I remember people asking, ‘It’s my birthday–can I take the day off?’ and he’d be like, ‘Are you out of your mind ? Fuck your birthday! OK, happy birthday, but no, you can’t take the day off!’ ”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Now that same intensity is focused on filling an American Apparel-size hole in his life with a company that is a lot like it–a made-in-America basics brand that’s labor friendly and geared to the youth market. “Authenticity is our message, you understand?” he tells me one day as we inch along on the 110. “Because the real Los Angeles isn’t Baywatch. It isn’t da-da-da-da-da-daaaa! ” He sings the Entertainment Tonight theme song. “It’s these immigrant communities. It’s Chinatown, Koreatown. They haven’t been institutionalized. They’re little pockets of time.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The ideas are swirling. Maybe he’ll update a classic sweatshirt or design a flat-soled slipper. He’s thinking about incubating a training program in prisons, too. “We don’t want to exploit prisoners, but when they come out, they can work for us,” Charney says.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“Look. It’s a huge challenge, but I’m going to catch up to where we were and carry on,” he adds. “It’s not for the money. I want the glory of building a business that challenges culture and advances humanity. At American Apparel we challenged notions of beauty, branding, manufacturing. I was having an impact on the culture of L.A., which is one of the Romes of the moment. And I want to continue.” He puts his foot on the gas and nudges forward. “That’s why I’m back in the ring.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Los Angeles Apparel is a wholesale operation for now, with a plan to eventually go retail, as American Apparel did after waiting 14 years to open its first store, in Echo Park in 2003. All in good time, though. “I’m still getting my product story together,” he tells me on another day.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Where Los Angeles Apparel differs most is in streamlining and efficiency. Charney calls it “rapid reaction urban manufacturing”–swift production cycles, less paperwork. American Apparel 2.0. “Like the Beatles,” he says. “If John Lennon went solo, he’d still sound similar, right? I’m just going to start singing again.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>In this analogy, however, Lennon is haunted, unable to let go of the old band. For instance, one afternoon in his dining room, Charney is chatting with clients, a couple of military veterans from the Midwest who run a charity for servicemen. At first he talks about the production cycle, the shoulder stitching, but then he devolves into a rant about American Apparel, how dark corporate forces conspired to oust him, how they lied and cheated and offered him a consulting contract for a million six a year if only he’d sit back and accept the new CEO, Paula Schneider. But did he accept it? “I said, ‘Noooooo! ‘ ” We all look up–the veterans, myself, staffers. Charney is standing at the end of the table, holding a chair above his head and roaring. “Fuck you! ”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Another time, at Zankou Chicken on Sunset Boulevard, he acts out the whole saga–the tale of a libertine entrepreneur Machiavellied out of his own company by sharks in suits–under the tube lights for me and a few bemused diners. He leaps from the molded seat and falls to his knees, shaking his fists. He waves a drumstick in the air and yells, “They fucking lied to me, man! ”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney was wary of me at first. Journalists hadn’t gotten his story right, he said. It was too complicated. That night at Zankou, though, the floodgates open. In the past six months or so, I’ve heard the story maybe 30 times. He’d call at midnight with a fresh memory, a new piece of evidence or wrinkle in the plot, each time replenishing his outrage. We spent days together at his house poring over legal filings, contracts, and e-mails. We role-played text conversations.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>It all started when, according to Charney, American Apparel’s then-CFO John Luttrell persuaded the board to fire him and sell the company–a claim also made in an unresolved wrongful-termination lawsuit by a former employee, David Nisenbaum. (Luttrell declined my requests for an interview, as did several board members.) Desperate, Charney borrowed $20 million from the hedge fund Standard General to buy back a majority stake from the fund and reinstall himself. But the hedge fund withheld the full voting rights of his shares, pending a board investigation into his sexual conduct. Charney claims that Standard General managing partner Soo Kim assured him of a positive outcome, since he effectively controlled the “suitability committee” that would review the investigation. Charney’s mother, Sylvia Safdie, a fine artist in Montreal, says Kim told her the same thing. In a text to Charney, Kim described the investigation as “kabuki dance.” However, a Standard General spokesperson, who asked to remain unidentified, told me, “Dov hears what he wants to hear.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The hedge fund soon allied itself with the board, citing Charney’s alleged sexual misconduct. But without him the company quickly declined. So within a year this beacon for made-in-America manufacturing, one of the biggest employers in L.A., was bankrupt and hemorrhaging jobs. A consortium of creditors took over, including Goldman Sachs, and last November, after another bankruptcy, Gildan Activewear bought the company. Cue store closures, massive layoffs, and a factory on life support. “Some fucking gonifs took my fucking business; it’s as simple as that,” Charney tells me. “That means ‘thieves’ in Yiddish. This was a crime.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Today Standard General is suing him for the $20 million it loaned him, but there are other battlefronts, too: a defamation suit Charney filed against American Apparel (with whom he is also contesting his termination), even a case against his former lawyers. Some mornings he’ll start his day at his desk, on the phone with a Delaware judge and the Standard General lawyers as an assistant videos him with an iPhone. Moving on just isn’t an option.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>What Charney describes is a clash of cultures–corporate versus maverick, institutional versus individual–that dates to 2007, when American Apparel went public, raising $280 million and fast-tracking its retail expansion around the world. From then on he’d have to answer to a board, half of which he’d picked himself; eight years later the board would fire Charney for being essentially the person he’d always been.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>His reputation preceded him for good and for ill. Complaints kept coming about this short-tempered CEO who walked around in his underwear, hurled abuse at underperforming employees, and fostered an aggressively sexual workplace. While he was known for hiring applicants based on their looks, Charney was also known for entrusting young staffers and promoting them wildly.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“They were kids!” says Allan Mayer, who became a board member at Charney’s request after being brought in as a crisis PR specialist to help with the early sex scandals, not the least of which was masturbating in front of that journalist. But Charney sees “kids” as his target market and inspiration. “I like 15- to 22-year-olds because I know what they want,” he says. “And maybe I haven’t matured myself. I’m not married. A lot of people stay with the young all their lives–Mick Jagger, Warhol, Karl Lagerfeld, Valentino.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Mayer compares Charney to a 14-year-old, and he has a point. Charney is profane, mischievious, playful. He invites the affectionate chiding of maternal figures, and he savors notoriety. An advocate of free love, free expression, and “sticking it to the Man,” he views himself as a rebel in the ’60s tradition, the Lenny Bruce of V-neck tees.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“It was utopian,” says Iris Alonzo of her days working for Charney. At 23 she was sent to travel throughout Asia and Europe to scope out new retail locations. By 27 she was creative director. “Don’t get me wrong,” she says. “He was very demanding. The hours were long, it was low pay–all that. But it was a creatively wholesome place where it didn’t matter what kind of freak you were; everyone could just do their thing.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Though Charney’s idealism elicits eye rolls from some, it propelled the company to early success, giving it the feel of a movement, with its overt sexual energy and charismatic leader. To this day those close to Charney talk of “the cult of Dov” and describe some staffers as “devotees.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“ ‘Cult’ sounds so negative,” says Charney. “How about ‘culture’? I created a culture that people wanted to be part of. That’s what branding is about!”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>With idealism, however, comes naïveté. On this count, allies and antagonists agree: Charney is too trusting. Nativo Lopez, former head of the immigrant rights organization Hermandad Mexicana, has seen him be swayed by unscrupulous workers. The day he was ousted, Charney arrived at the board meeting in high spirits, oblivious that he was about to be fired. Days later Alonzo watched him sign that fateful $20 million deal with Standard General. “They duped me, OK?” Charney says. This is the one lesson he seems to take away from his experience. “There were ways that I didn’t protect myself,” he says, “and by doing that, I didn’t protect the thousands of jobs involved. That’s it.” He throws his hands up. “I need to be a lot more careful about who I bring near me.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“His strengths are his weaknesses,” says Charney’s father, Morris, an architect in Montreal. “I think his undoing was his openness. It makes you vulnerable.” Mayer tells me something similar. Like a tragic hero in the Greek tradition, he says, Charney “was brought down by the very things that made him great.” Mayer cites his micromanaging as a flipside of his concern for the business, but his words could also be applied to how Charney’s relentless work ethic, for example, made him an irascible manager and how his ambition pushed him to grow American Apparel too fast.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>More than anything, it was his dual focus on sex and youth that led to his downfall, even as it transformed American Apparel into a cultural touchstone. Charney slept with his staff until the end. In the year of his firing, investigators uncovered a number of lurid e-mails, pictures, and videos that Mayer describes as “lawsuits waiting to happen.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The most recent sexual harassment lawsuits were filed three years earlier, in 2011. A New York lawyer, Eric Baum, had gathered five ex-employees who alleged various forms of sexual harassment. One, Irene Morales, demanded $260 million, claiming Charney had forced her to be his sex slave. Yet she contacted him, offering sex, long after the alleged abuse. It looked fishy. “I was tarred, feathered, and fucked!” says Charney. Mayer phrases it more diplomatically: “If there was a suit where Dov was set up, it was that one.” He and the board went on to renew Charney’s contract in 2012.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Peter Schey was the investigating attorney for the company at the time. He runs the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which protects trafficked women. Money was at the forefront when he went to meet Baum in New York. “In essence,” Schey says, “he told me, ‘I have a young woman who was a teen sex slave for Dov, and it’s going to be a nuclear explosion in the media. So we need’–I forget what it was, $1.5 million or $2 million–‘within ten days.’ It felt like extortion.” Shortly after, two of the plaintiffs appeared on Good Morning America. (Baum declined to comment or connect me with the plaintiffs for this piece.)
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Schey believes Charney had a physical relationship with only three of the five women and that the other two were making it up. “But they weren’t completely without merit,” he says. “Anytime a workplace relationship ends, one side may feel that it was oppressive. But I think it appeared to Dov as if it was consensual, and most reasonable people would have felt the same way given the nature of the communications.” Three cases went to a judge, who cleared Charney of sexual harassment; the other two went to arbitration.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The litigation costs were substantial: $8.2 million in all, though insurance picked up $7 million of that. They relate almost entirely not to sexual harassment but to a separate charge of failing to prevent another employee from posting a series of disparaging impersonation blogs in the names of Charney’s accusers. Still, Charney doesn’t accept that his behavior might, at the very least, have exposed the company to litigation. Rather, he brags about his victory–“not a single finding of sexual harassment against me!”–and that no such suit was filed during his final 36 months as CEO.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Mayer doesn’t see that as a defense. “I have a 14-year-old daughter,” he says, “so these issues are not abstract. There are questions of law and ethics and morality.” He calls Charney “a predator.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>For Charney, this talk about his sex life was just a pretext to fire him, a distraction from more important matters, such as the vast transfer of wealth from shareholders and workers to hedge funds and lawyers. He remains oblivious to the unsightly optics of an older, powerful CEO sleeping with his shopgirls. “Anyway,” he grins. “ ‘Predator’ is so subjective. I can’t tell you how many girls say ‘fuck me like you’re a sexual predator’ while I’m stuffing them.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>At times it sounds so Hollywood, a modern parable of sexual politics and corporate culture, a treacherous hedge fund and the death of a factory, all dovetailing, as it were, around one uniquely divisive figure. “They hoist a guy out of his company, he fights like a pig to get it back, and there’s this evil conglomerate of Wall Street investors, right?” is how Charney sums it up. He likens his story to The Big Short. “I cried when I saw that film because that’s what they did to me.” He shows me e-mails from people interested in directing his tale, including Adrian Grenier from Entourage.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>One night we sit outside his house in his Hyundai Accent, and he says, “Usually there’s a winner and a loser with these things, but no one made money here. There are only losers–like the shareholders, myself, the workers, thousands of them fired, the suppliers…. And now they keep their foot on my throat because, God forbid, I should survive to tell the story.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>He points to his home. “I don’t need all this. I’ll move into an apartment–I don’t give a fuck. But I need the truth to come out. Because I was doing good for society. I’m employing people, I’m an exporter, and all of a sudden it’s taken away–from everyone.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>To Mayer, however, Charney isn’t the victim of the story: He tanked the business to such a degree that its subsequent bankruptcy 15 months later is his fault. “You can’t blame that on the new people,” he says. “It’s like blaming Obama for the recession.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>That assessment overlooks something as well, though: Charney’s effectiveness at driving the brand. As Lloyd Greif, a Los Angeles investment banker, says, “The first place the board went wrong was their choice of replacement CEO…. When Dov left, the company’s performance went off a cliff.” Greif characterizes Charney’s reign as a thrill ride, growing American Apparel too quickly, taking on mountains of debt at high interest, and navigating choppy waters at that, buffeted by the rise of fast fashion and the decline of brick-and-mortar retail. He was fired, Greif says, because “the board was concerned that time had run out. No banks were willing to lend. They had to try something new.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>It’s true that by the time Charney was fired, American Apparel was gasping for air under all that debt, despite revenues of $634 million the previous year. But Charney says banks were willing to lend to him. He argues–as do others, such as the analyst David Felman, who works with Greif–that the salient figure for the financial community isn’t net loss or profit but adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, aka EBITDA. By that yardstick the company was bouncing back: $7.4 million in the first half of 2013 and $16 million in the first half of 2014, the year of Charney’s firing. That year Irving Place Capital offered to buy the company at a valuation of $400 million and reinstall Charney as CEO. The proposal was rebuffed, and in the first half of 2015, EBITDA dropped to minus $4 million under Paula Schneider. Bankruptcy soon followed.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>In October I find Charney standing in a dusty backyard on 28th Street and Central Avenue before an audience of 60 workers, mostly women, all Latino. The layoffs have begun at American Apparel, foreshadowing the 2,400 firings to come in January, and the workers here–some still employed at Charney’s old company, some not–are anxious about their future. Charney grabs a microphone, speaking in short sentences, so that the lead organizer, Nativo Lopez, can translate.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“I’m very excited,” he says, “and I want you to be excited, too. I’m sorry this was so painful. They took everything I had. But you know what they didn’t take? Our knowledge of manufacturing.” He goes on to deliver a rousing Any Given Sunday speech. Charney is in fine form.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>He bounded in today, arms raised like a champion, and he was greeted with applause and hugs. Many here wear “I ♥ Dov” T-shirts, as they did when protesting the new leadership, under whom workers became subject to searches by security and were denied access to management.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>This is the second such gathering this year, a chance for Charney to rally supporters and hire talent. Yesterday was his biggest sales day yet, and today he’s looking for a crew to work weekends. “If we get an order on Friday, we can ship on Monday!” he says. Even more efficient than American Apparel had been in its day. “We’re going to disrupt the apparel industry again!”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“Destroy?” asks a lady in the front row.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“No, disrupt,” says Charney. “It’s a big word in the business world. I know that right now it looks small, but I know what I’m doing. We’re getting organized to build a $500 million-plus company.” As he speaks, a flock of screeching parrots flies overhead, and a murmur goes through the crowd. “It’s a sign!”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>At the end three women hand checks to Charney’s assistants totaling $4,000. They’re loans that could potentially be converted to stock, should he go that route–a new approach to funding a company and keeping it “Goldman Sachs free,” as Charney says, by making the workers stakeholders. It took Caterina Hernandez six months to save $1,000, and she knows she may never get it back if Charney’s company sinks. “That’s OK,” she says. “It’s thanks to Dov that I can live comfortably. I pray for him every night.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>When the ax eventually falls in January, groups of workers will march directly to Charney’s new factory space to sweep and ready the place for nothing. They’re counting on him.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney’s bonds with L.A.’s Latino community go back to 1997, when American Apparel set up in the city, making T-shirts that it sold wholesale. It wasn’t simply that he paid above the minimum wage and offered health benefits. He also made amnesty for undocumented immigrants a campaign at the company, painting a huge “Legalize LA” mural on his downtown factory wall.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>His loyalties were tested in 2009, in the depths of the recession, when American Apparel went through a bruising immigration audit. Rather than circle the wagons around management and fire undocumented workers, Charney hired Peter Schey, who fought Proposition 187, which would have restricted access to public services by undocumented immigrants and their children. “He wanted a thorough review of every case,” Schey says. “And when [employees] wanted to march to support immigration reform, right in the middle of that audit, not only did [Charney] say, ‘Yes, take the time off,’ he marched with them.” After a 20-month federal investigation, 1,500 workers had to go–a huge chunk of the workforce. But the government found no negligence or ill intent on the company’s part.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>While Charney’s stance on immigration embodies a libertarian’s philosophy of free movement in a borderless world, there’s more to it than that. Born in Montreal, he grew up around immigrants. His grandmother on his father’s side was a garment worker from Poland, and his grandfather a staunch socialist who opened his home to refugees during the war. His mother’s father, meanwhile, was a garment manufacturer from Aleppo, and one of the first Canadians to trade with China. According to Charney’s mother, they all had a profound influence. Charney came to embody these three things: socialism, entrepreneurship, and empathy for the worker.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>She recalls a boy who challenged authority and never heard the word no. “He took up a lot of space,” she says. He was seven when his parents divorced, an amicable-enough split. After a few years of living with his mom, though, he decided that he wanted to spend more time with his father and called an attorney. Not content with delivering newspapers, he started publishing one for kids, which his classmates sold at bus stops. He was 11. And when he became interested in photography, he built a darkroom in his mother’s closet. Every project was taken to its limits. He began printing T-shirts in his room at Tufts University; when he decided he wanted to leave college to concentrate on that full-time, his mother knew that resistance was futile. “He pushed and pushed,” she says. “They used to say at American Apparel, ‘He nags and nags until he gets his way.’ ”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>A mellow afternoon at the Apex house. Charney is in his bedroom, Swiffer-ing the floors and organizing legal papers. His assistants sit at laptops in the dining room. Then a knock at the door. Houston, the photographer, is with his model friend Max, a bashful, college-age boy in flannel shorts. They’re doing a shoot in the attic, the first pictures for the Los Angeles Apparel Web site, and Max wants to meet Dov.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“God, look at this guy!” Charney exclaims. “No pimples! He’s a fucking genius! Here, you want to wet his hair down at the sides like this,” he says, pressing down his curls. “See? Ralph Lauren, 1994. Tell me, Max, how many girls are dying for you right now?”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Max blushes and shrugs.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“We’re going to need restraining orders,” Charney says. “OK? Restraining orders! ”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He rushes to his computer and plays a clip of 1969’s Midnight Cowboy–Jon Voight getting ready to go out as a rent boy. “OK, Max. This is you, boy! This fucking movie is hipper than the hippest kids in the hippest restaurant in Echo Park. Back then, it was all about New York, but now it’s L.A. New York got sold. Allan Mayer took over New York.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>It’s like the early days at American Apparel. He didn’t once consider launching a different kind of company. When I ask, he laughs: “What–like a TV station? I’m in the shmatte business!” American Apparel was successful, so why change? The new boss will absolutely be like the old boss, workplace relationships and all. “Welcome advances are permitted under the law,” he says. “Fifty-seven percent of people meet their partners at work. And that’s not just for me. It’s for everyone. God forbid that two people who work together should fall in love.” The real figure is more like 10 percent, but Second Act Charney is unrepentant. “I did my best,” he says. “I cared for that company like it was my child. I don’t think there’s much I did wrong.”

    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">    <p> NEW YORK (Reuters) - An internal investigation at American Apparel Inc has found that its CEO Dov Charney violated company policies, ranging from misusing company funds to failing to stop the discrediting of at least one former employee who had accused him of sexual harassment, a person close to the matter said.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">    <p> The company’s board ousted the 45-year-old Charney as chairman on Wednesday, citing unspecified allegations of misconduct. It suspended him as president and chief executive officer, and plans to fire him for cause, following a 30-day period stipulated in his contract.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">    <p>The company's independent directors hired law firm Jones Day in mid-March to lead the investigation, said the person and a separate source familiar with the matter. It is unclear what events prompted the board to initiate the investigation, which is ongoing.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The probe revealed that Charney, who founded the hipster clothing brand, was using company funds to book flights for his parents, the person said. He also sometimes provided corporate apartments to friends and stayed in them himself when he wasn’t on company business, according to this person.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The investigation’s findings also included that Charney had known about but failed to stop a blog created by an American Apparel employee that displayed naked photographs of former saleswoman, Irene Morales, who had sued him, the person said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>A person familiar with Charney's thinking said that any use of photographs of the former employee by American Apparel was only done to counter her damaging allegations and the strategy was approved by other company officials.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>This person said that Charney believed any use of apartments was not material and was normal business practice. In terms of the travel charges, this person said Charney’s father is on American Apparel’s payroll and that his mother, although not an employee, is a retail and design contributor to the company.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney's employment contract entitled him to "vacation benefits and reimbursement of reasonable and necessary business expenses," according to a company filing in April. His father, Morris Charney, received $238,000 in architectural consulting and director fees from the company in 2013, the filing showed.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>A spokesman for American Apparel declined to comment. A representative for Jones Day was not immediately available for comment.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The company, which only has a market value of $120 million, has been struggling with weak sales and heavy debt. While the industry lauded Charney for his creativity, the company has been under fire for lax financial controls and concerns about the strength of its management team.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>In recent years, Charney has fought off a series of sexual harassment lawsuits. In one of the most high-profile cases, Morales claimed she was held as a teenage sex slave, forced to perform sexual acts during an eight-month period, including oral sex in Charney's Manhattan apartment just after she turned 18.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>A lawyer for American Apparel said in 2011 that it was Morales who had stalked Charney and was trying to "shake down" the company.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>In 2012, a New York judge ordered her $250 million claim to be arbitrated. The status of the arbitration proceedings could not be immediately determined.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>American Apparel is in talks to hire an investment bank, expected to be boutique Peter J. Solomon, one of the people close to the matter said. The bank, which could not be immediately reached for comment, will provide capital if the company's lenders declare it in default on some of its debt, the person said.

    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>It’s not normal for the board and shareholders of a publicly owned company to have to watch a video on YouTube of their chief executive dancing naked in front of female colleagues and wonder what to do about it.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>It’s not normal for the chief executive of a public company to face repeated, public and sleazy allegations of sexual misconduct even if the allegations are denied, dismissed, settled or sent to arbitration.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>And it’s not normal for a group of about 30 executives at a company to believe that one of them is so central to the company’s success that they immediately ask the board to reconsider their decision to fire him.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>But when that chief executive is American Apparel founder Dov Charney, the word “normal” – by his own admission – doesn’t always apply. Charney paints himself as above the fray of normal humanity, an exception to the usual rules.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“I was born strange,” Charney said in an American Public Media radio interview in June. In the same interview, Charney confided: “My biggest weakness is me. I mean, lock me up already. It’s obvious. Put me in a cage, I’ll be fine. I’m my own worst enemy. But what can you do. I was born strange.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“Sex is inextricably linked to fashion and apparel,” said Charney in the interview. “And it has been and always will be. And our clothing is connected to our sexual expression.”

</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Charney had been suspended by the board in June for “alleged misconduct and violations of company policy”; a special board committee oversaw an investigation by FTI Consulting into the allegations against him.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney had been retained as a consultant to American Apparel while under suspension as chief executive, but this arrangement has now been terminated. Still, Charney and other investors in American Apparel who have been his allies in the past are still major shareholders in the company, so it is unlikely the troubled fashion retailer has seen the last of the controversial Montreal-born entrepreneur.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The company has appointed respected fashion-industry veteran Paula Schneider as chief executive starting on 5 January. It hopes that after the unsavory headlines attracted by Charney, Schneider can bring stability and maturity to the edgy retailer famous for advertising that pushes the limits of acceptable sexuality.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“This company needs a permanent CEO who can bring stability and strong leadership in this time of transition, and we believe Ms. Schneider fits the bill perfectly,” said David Danziger, co-chairman of the board.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Schneider will need all her storied skills to turn around American Apparel. Under the leadership of Charney, its stock price, as high as $15 seven years ago, has been bumping along the basement of the stock market at well under a dollar. The company has posted roughly $300m in net losses since 2010, according to Bloomberg.

</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The allegations against Charney have included claims that he allowed an American Apparel staff member to post nude photographs on the internet of a former female employee who had taken legal action against him and that he misused company funds.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>In his CNBC interview Charney was asked if he saw himself as a “Steve Jobs meets Hugh Hefner” kind of chief executive, even though he later played down his comparison to Jobs.

</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Before Charney put American Apparel on the stock market, he was asked by TV interviewer Charlie Rose about going public – a move that would require accountability to a wide number of people. His answers were revealing.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“I wanna do it on my own terms,” said Charney. “I don’t want to institutionalize the company … I don’t mind keeping very accurate and very credible books and records … I want investors to believe in the company; I’m not trying to fool around with that.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>“But I also don’t want to be told what to do, or how our ad campaign should be or what our political positioning should be – at all.”
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>There’s a limit to this kind of free-market don’t-tell-me-what-to-do view. Companies aren’t just about their chief executives. They’re also about their workers, their ethics and their contribution to society. Silicon Valley, for one, is full of such iconoclasts, who are more than happy to take the immense wealth that going public brings them – but then often ignore the demands and rights of the investors who now own their companies and the regulators who try to keep them honest.

    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>July 31, 2006 &#151; -- Over the past three years, a new clothing store called American Apparel has been appearing in cities around the country. Nearly 150 new stores have opened, popping up in foreign capitals too, from Montreal to Paris to Tokyo. The company sells simple cotton leisure wear. Much of the apparel is for 20-something "contemporary metropolitan adults" as Dov Charney often calls his market.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"20/20" stopped by an American Apparel store in New York to meet the man who started the company, a fast-talking 37-year-old Canadian, Dov Charney, to learn more about his company.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>American Apparel is just a fraction of the size of established retailers like The Gap, but Charney's company has become one of the fastest-growing clothing makers in America. Over the past two years, Charney has opened more than 90 new retail stores. He began by wholesaling just a few styles of blank T-shirts. Now he's expanded his line to include sweatshirts, bathing suits, skirts, jackets and more. Much of it he says appeals to 20-somethings who like their clothes tighter than baby boomers do.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"There's the relaxed fit generation and then there's the next generation," he said. The next generation seems to like their clothing tight, and that's what Charney's giving them. "We like sexy at American Apparel. Absolutely," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>He also likes bold colors and has taken a bold approach to how he runs and promotes his company. It's very sexual. He decorates his stores with provocative, sexy images.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney says sexiness is all about attitude and style -- and he says he's always on the lookout for people who have it, like Natasha. After he noticed her walking down the street, he jumped out of his limo and asked her to model for his company, which she did. Now she works for American Apparel.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"We walk around the trade shows, looking hot," she explained. "The clothing is tighter. It's sexier. It's that next generation he's talking about," she explained.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney's structured his business in a way that allows him to capitalize on it. "We get an idea, you go to a vintage store, snap a picture of a garment that we think is hot and 20, 30 days later, we could have it in the stores," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>People like working here, says Charney's creative adviser, Iris Alonzo. "You know, it's like, I wake up in the morning and want to make some crazy sweatshirt and we can actually do it," Alonzo said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>By his own admission, Charney has always been a particularly hyper guy. By the time he got to college, Charney says, he found a way to channel all that energy. He started a business, buying shirts at Kmart, and exporting them to Canada. "I started bringing like 5,000, 10,000 T-shirts at a time, on a U-Haul truck in the summer, and I developed a kind of importing business, from the United States to Canada. That's why it's called American Apparel," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Then, he dropped out of college, borrowed $10,000 from his father and moved to South Carolina to manufacture clothes. But after Charney arrived, the rest of the garment industry had discovered it could make clothing much more cheaply overseas. So they did, and Charney's business crashed.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The business went bankrupt and he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. But that didn't stop him. He reorganized his company -- determined to make it work.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"I knew I could do it differently, and I knew I could turn it around. And I knew there was a solution and there was no way, that kind of passion or can-do spirit; I said there's no way I'm stopping now," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"Passion," Charney said, is the key to success.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"When you believe in what you're doing, that's the first thing. And you have to be resilient, because people are going to try to knock you down," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney moved his business to California -- and nine years later, his business is now thriving in an 800,000-square-foot factory in downtown Los Angeles. Charney is doing something most other fashion lines have long abandoned: he makes all the clothing right here -- in the United States.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Today, American Apparel has more than 4,000 employees. One of the first to join up was Annabelle Morency, 32, who is now head of manufacturing. "This is the place to be. It's a great ride at American Apparel," she said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The company's staff is young -- most are in their 20s -- whether they work in product development and design, customer service and sales or graphics and marketing. But when Charney needed someone to reorganize his manufacturing operations he called seasoned clothing maker Marty Bailey, who had been in the garment industry for some 20 years, working for big companies like Fruit of the Loom.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Bailey, now vice president of operations for American Apparel, dramatically improved efficiency by reconfiguring the factory's sewing operation into groups with eight to 10 people each doing a different task on a single garment. Baily calls it "team manufacturing."
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"Every nine seconds there's a garment moving from operator to operator. We have teams that are producing 3,000 pieces a day. Right now, I can manufacture a T-shirt from start to finish in 90 seconds," Bailey said. And that's made the business competitive in a way that few other American clothing companies are. "As a result of this system, we're able to compete with China and kick ass the American way," Charney said, adding that the factory now produces 1 million garments a week.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney calls it "an Industrial Revolution" because his company is "vertically integrated," meaning everything happens in Los Angeles, from knitting the cotton fabric he uses, to dyeing it, to cutting it -- then the sewers get it and turn the pieces into finished garments.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney says this one-stop shop saves him money. "It's less expensive, for me, the way we do business, to manufacture here in the United States. There's a high cost to going offshore. If you're working with a supplier in China, you've got to work months in advance. If you're working with your own factory, you can wake up one morning and say, 'Hey, let's make 10,000 tank tops today,'" he explained. "You know the face of your worker ... engineers and designers and finance people and knitters and dyers and chemists can come together in one location and say, 'How can we do this better?' You can produce products more efficiently than they can be made on an outsource basis."
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Most of Charney's factory workers are immigrants -- all of them documented, Charney says. He pays them a base salary of $8 to $9 an hour, but the sewing teams are also paid by the piece. The more the team produces, the more it earns. "We designed the rate in such a way that the average person should be able to make $100 a day, that's our target," Charney said. Currently, he says the average wage for garment workers at American Apparel is $12.75 hour.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney says by paying more than other companies he motivates his employees to work harder. The company even posts what the workers earn each time period so they can see how much they are making.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"We want to pay more than the prevailing wages in Los Angeles, because we want to have the happiest work force we can have. It's really important -- $9 dollars an hour versus $12 an hour -- it's like a total lifestyle change," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney also offers his workers subsidized lunches and health care benefits. There are free English classes offered throughout the day -- and he's even got five massage therapists on site to relieve the sewers' stress.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>It seems Charney's business concepts are working. This year, Charney says, total sales should exceed $300 million -- and he's planning to open another 20 stores in just the next few months. But while he's still building and expanding American Apparel, which is privately owned, Charney says he doesn't really have a big salary like many CEOs. He takes less than $100,000 a year out of the business for expenses -- enough to pay the bills on his modest home, which is located in the same neighborhood where many of his workers live.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Some say a reason for Charney's success is that he makes his employees enthusiastic -- by making his company a casual, open and free work environment. Charney feels free to engage in consensual relationships with his staff. He decorates his stores with shots of the sexy but non-professional models he uses in his ad campaigns; and in some stores vintage sex magazines are used as design elements. He sometimes uses foul language at work and doesn't mind if some of his employees do too.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>But some people say Charney's freewheeling style has gone too far.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Three sex harassment lawsuits were filed by former employees, one of them claiming he fostered a "hostile work environment based on her sex." Charney is quick to point out, "None of these plaintiffs are accusing me of having an intimate relationship with them," adding, "I've never had any intimate intentions with these women. I never propositioned them in any way."
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Among the charges in the lawsuits, Charney was accused of making "unwelcome, inappropriate comments, suggestive nonverbal signals ... dropping his pants, revealing his underwear."
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"All these allegations are false," Charney said. But he added he doesn't see any problem with wearing underwear in the office if it's connected to his work. "I think for a designer to be in his underwear when he's designing underwear is quite common. And I'm in my underwear in my office all the time," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney's openness about sex got particularly embarrassing when he agreed to an interview with a reporter from Jane magazine. They became friendly, she went to his New York City residence, watched him engage in sexual activity, and later wrote an article that included details of his sex life.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney said it was a "consensual exchange." He added, "I had no idea she was going to write about my personal life in the way she did."
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The writer confirmed to us that what transpired was consensual. But the publicity didn't help his cause when, months later, women sued, claiming a hostile work environment.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney said he thinks his success in building American Apparel into a $200 million per year business may have made him a target of these lawsuits.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"I think it's about employees that are trying to take advantage of American Apparel and the success of our company to enrich themselves, and I feel these women have contrived their claims," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>The women who filed the suits declined our request for interviews. As it stands now, one lawsuit was thrown out and another was settled.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"There's a sexual element to fashion. That's inescapable," Charney said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>But does an environment of freedom in the workplace mean having sex with people who work for you?
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"No, I don't think it means having sex with people that work for me. As far as consensual relationships, between various employees, we don't regulate that at American Apparel. ... I think that those relationships can be very healthy and are an important part of living in a free world," he said.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney says freedom is everything to him, both in his personal life and how he runs his company -- and says the results are proof that it's working. "I think we're gonna build a great company. ... We want to compete on the merits, and we believe in what we're doing, and we want to build the best apparel company that ever was in America."

    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>AS expected by many, former American Apparel CEO Dov Charney is not taking his dismissal from the retailer lying down and has filed a lawsuit against Standard General - the hedge-fund that holds three of the nine board of directors' seats - for $30 million in damages.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>Charney claims that the company falsely stated that he was fired last December for misconduct (after years of legal wrangling) based on the results of an independent investigation, alleging that it was "a sham" and was carried out by the board, "the very people who wanted to fire Charney, who conspired against him to wrest away control of the company," reports Bloomberg Business.</p>
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p>"There was no independent, third-party investigation of Charney that led to his termination," said the filed complaint. Last year, Charney was vocal in his critique of his former employer, saying: "I gave them my entire life's work and they agreed to put me back in. But, instead, they used this investigation to fire me. They betrayed me."</p>

    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">    <p>A young woman who worked as a sales associate for American Apparel has filed a lawsuit accusing the company’s CEO of harassing her to the point of mental breakdown, and then after that turning her into his “sex slave” on her 18th birthday. In a suit that demands a whopping $250 million from the legendarily lecherous fashion magnate, the woman alleges that he began bothering her when she was working in an American Apparel store at the age of 17. According to the court filings, Charney threatened her with firing if she did not tell him about her sexual history and send him explicit pictures and consent to have sex with him on the day she turned 18.
</h1>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">    <p>When that day came, the woman claims she turned up at his apartment. Charney answered the door in his underwear, she says, and “dragged her to the bedroom, threw her on the bed, got on top of her and forced her to perform another act of fellatio, nearly suffocating her in the process.” She adds that she was then “held prisoner” for several hours and several additional sex acts.</p></h1></div>
